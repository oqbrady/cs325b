2) Unzip the files
3) Run the Data processing notebook to chip all of the images.
4) Run tghe xgboost model and then the Task_2 model notebooks to get weights for every model in the inference pipeline.
5) You now have weights to load in Inference pulic leaderboard notebook and generate predicitons.
